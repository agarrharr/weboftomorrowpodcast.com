Thanks for coming on the show! Here are a few things you should know to be prepared.

## Advance Preparation

Episode planning happens on the [GitHub repo issues](/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aepisode). Please comment on the issue with the following information.

- Your name
- Your twitter handle
- Your email address so I can share a Google doc with you (or DM me on Twitter ([@adamCoder](https://twitter.com/adamcoder)))

## Show Notes

- We will create a basic outline in the Google doc
- During/after the episode you can add any relevant links for things you've mentioned in the show. I prefer links to Wikipedia, Amazon, the official website, or the Github repo.

## 10 Minutes Before Recording

- Give yourself about 10 minutes before the call to get setup
- Make sure Skype is installed and you're signed in
- Wear headphones
- Silence your phone
- Record separately if possible (You can use Quicktime (on mac), or Screenflow)
- Don't touch the microphone
- Don't touch anything that the microphone is touching or the sound will be amplified (if the mic is on a desk, don't touch the desk)
- Use a external microphone if possible
- Use the Skype test call to test your microphone
- Make sure other people in the house / building know you're recording so they don't make noise
- Put pets in another room or outside, if you think think they might make noise

## During the Call

- The episodes are about 15 minutes, so we record for about 20 minutes
- I edit the audio, so if you mess up, you can pause and then start over again
